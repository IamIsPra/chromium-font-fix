# Font Fix for Chromium Browsers - Extension (Quick Fix)

**Note: This extension is a quick fix to resolve the issue of English content displaying with Sinhala letters on certain websites in Chromium-based browsers, such as Edge and Chrome.**

Your feedback and support are valuable, and I'm committed to making this extension even better. Stay tuned for updates!
